I am 22 years old; I have been programming on the web for 5 years. I am self-taught, I learned thanks to the internet and several courses that I took and that I still do. I care a lot about keeping my code clean and scalable.
I am a very good partner and a future great leader. I like new challenges as they test me and help my desire to grow as a professional.
Currently I work with this technologies: 

- PHP/Laravel/Lumen/Symfony
- Redis
- MySQL/Oracle/Postgres
- MongoDB
- Firestore
- Node JS
- Dart/Flutter
- GraphQL
- Golang
- PLSQL
- Typescript
